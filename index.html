<p>
    I'm a third-year <strong>PhD student at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)</strong> at the <strong>Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</strong> doing research on <strong>machine learning theory</strong>.
    <br><br>
    My current research lies in the intersection between <strong>graph representation learning</strong>, <strong>manifold learning</strong> and <strong>signal processing</strong>, advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://luanaruiz9.github.io/">Luana Ruiz</a>.
    <br><br>
    Originally from <strong>Brazil</strong>, I obtained a master's and bachelor's in electrical and computer engineering from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, a leading university in Latin America.
